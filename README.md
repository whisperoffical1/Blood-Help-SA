Hello and welcome to my easily configerable simple command script.

This script is very simple to setup and use for basic use, If you plan to configere this to a notification system then you may need a bit of coding expiereience.

## INSTALLATION

Drag and drop the folder into your **"RESOURCES"** folder and then ensure it in your **"server.cfg"**.

Now open the **"help"** folder and then open the **"config.lua** and configure it to how you want it to be, Each configeration line has an explaination next to it so you can easily configere it without getting confused.

This script is **OWNED** and **COPYRIGHTED** by the **OWNERS** of the script (BLD-Scripting)

If you wish to configere this more then you can do so in the **"client.lua"**, Have fun and make sure to check out my other work!!!
